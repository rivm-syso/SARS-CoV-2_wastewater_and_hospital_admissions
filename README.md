# How to use with own data

To use the scripts with your own data sets, the following three data sets are needed:

  - _df_variants_ with columns:
      -  date: The date
      -  variant: The variant name, which should include for all variants in _variant_names_ in 0. settings, and only include those variants.
      -  percentage_variant: The relative presence on day _x_ of variant _y_ and should lie between 0 and 1.
  
  - _df_vaccination_ with columns:
      - date: The date
      - municipality: The municipalities which are included in the model. (Should be the same municipalities as in _df_municipality_).
      - age_group: The different age groups which are considered. (Should be the age groups as in _df_municipality_). If not 5, then _initials_hosp_ in 0. function should be updated to reflect the number of age groups.
      - vaccination: The different vaccination statuses included in the model, which should include the statuses in _vaccination_status_ in 0. settings.
      - percentage_vaccination: The vaccination coverage on day _x-t_ of vaccination status _y_, with _t_ the time it takes for a vaccine to become fully effective after administration. Vaccination coverage should lie between 0 and 1 and for a given day, municipality, and age group it should add to 1.
    
  - _df_municipality_ with columns:
      - date: The date
      - municipality: The municipalities which are included in the model. (Should be the same municipalities as in _df_vaccination_).
      - age_group: The different age groups which are considered. (Should be the age groups as in _df_vaccination_). If not 5, then _initials_hosp_ in 0. function should be updated to reflect the number of age groups.
      - load: The 10-log of the virus load at day _x_ in municipality _y_
      - hospitalizations: The number of hospitalisations at day _x_ in municipality _y_ of age group _z_. Should be an integer greater than or equal to 0.
      - population: The population at day _x_ of municipality _y_ of age group _z_, which should be at least 1.
